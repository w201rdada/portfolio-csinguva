I am a huge fan of Peter Norvig’s book Artificial Intelligence and I joined MIDS program to learn hard skills to build intelligent systems of the future. To build intelligent systems, we need to start with defining the research problems and intended audience. I kickoff my learning journey outlining two ideas I plan to work in next 12 months: Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Farmer Chatbots Farmers are dependent on key information to make decisions to improve their crop yield. The information is related to weather conditions, rainfall, and plant protection. Farmers in developing countries have difficulty finding this information and many countries provide agricultural assistance programs to help farmers to improve best practices data access. Indian government currently provides the farmer assistance services using helpline and automated sms based weather alerts to registered farmers. Only five percent of 15 million farmers are taking advantage of the helpline service. The government also intends to expand coverage to 100 million farmers and is requesting proposals to explore alternative ideas to scale the service. Our team is proposing to build a Farmer Chatbot, which utilizes machine learning to scale this helpline service and making the information they need available whenever they want it. Our vision is disruptive, however we are using a staggered development path to deliver a fully automated Chatbot. Our proposal outlines the first step of building a machine learning supervised helpline service. Mining the fine print - Privacy Scoring FinTech companies leverage new technology to create new and better financial services for both consumers and businesses. These emerging technologies are disrupting investment management, insurance and lending industries creating better user experiences reducing friction. FinTech companies use machine learning and user information to personalize traditional financial services. When users signup for FinTech applications, the application developers request users to provide access personal information like social security information, banking transactions, savings, social media handles and other mobile data. There are many cases where the applications monitor extremely private information like location and voice call information which are not needed to personalize the applications. Even though users agree to terms and conditions of using the applciations, the privacy policies are embedded in the fine text of terms and conditions. The privacy policy conformance to user privacy regulations like COPPA, GDPR is difficult to comprehend. Our project intends to develop an app which can be installed on smartphone and will monitor the data access and usage by various FinTech applications. We use a staggered approach to develop our project and the first step is a detailed study of privacy policies of top 500 FinTech applications on App Store &amp; Google Play.

["ML-for-farmers.html", "1 AgriBots: ML for farmers 1.1 Problem Overview 1.2 Proposed Solution 1.3 Outcomes", " 1 AgriBots: ML for farmers Keywords Agriculture, Machine Learning, Chatbot 1.1 Problem Overview Farmers in Indian markets have low exposure to best practices on improving farming yield and crop lifecycle management. Indian Government is helping farmers using call centers to answer questions &amp; alerts on advisories. Close to 140 million farmers in India currently don’t have access to the schemes run by the Government(Agricultural Census 2018). To complicate the problem further, Indian farmers speak 122 different languages, grow different crops across various land profiles. Even though Indian farmers are gaining access to cheaper smartphones and internet data, the Government isn’t even able to cover less than 1% of the farmer population with their current initiatives. Need for large human resources, language competencies and farming expertise are limiting the scale of program success to a larger percentage of farmers. 1.2 Proposed Solution To solve this problem, we plan to develop intelligent chatbots which can take SMS or voice questions from farmers in natural language and reply with real-time information reliably without manual intervention. The farmer segments and possibile solutions are broken down into following segments: In cases where the bot cannot understand the query, a human being will intervene and provide a feedback loop to the chatbot. This real-time feedback loop will be crowdsourced to improve the capabilities of the chatbot making it an evolving system improving farmer welfare. The basic components needed to build this system are: a) SMS’s translation engine: The purpose of this component is to translate the questions posted by farmers into English and translate the answers from English to the local language. b) Speech Recognition: Use to support farmers who are illiterate and can only speak in local language. This component takes voice input, translate it to English or local language and using automatic voice updates, provides feedback to the farmers. c) Farmer Database: Every farmer will use their phone number to register to the application. As they provide ask questions, we will use the information to build the farmer profile (phone numbers, location, crops). The information of individual farmers will be private and only aggregate information at city/county level will be shared to monitor trends. d) Q&amp;A Engine: This will be used to identify if a question asked by farmer can be intelligently answered without ambiguity based on text mining the training data available. Also used to store information on most asked query types and available API’s to retrieve information on the query types. Example: Weather data which can be retrieved on a real-time basis from publicly available API’s. e) Feedback Engine - New Questions: When a question cannot be answered without ambiguity, the chatbot stages this question for manual intervention for feedback to improve the training data and effectiveness of Q&amp;A engine. f) Learning by Leveraging the Crowd: The effectiveness of Agribot as well as feedback on new questions can be improved by crowdsourcing the issues and taking feedback from NGO’s, Government entities, agri experts and farmer cooperatives &amp; societies. The flow to capture this should be automated as well based on incidence of an issue type and significance to existing user base. g) Agribot Effectiveness: In addition to unsupervised learning on the datasets, the Agribot should also request feedback from farmers to improve &amp; validate precision and accuracy. Need to develop feature sets to include this workflow into the feedback engine. (Lowe and Preckel 2004) 1.3 Outcomes The outcome of this solution is to improve scaling the Government initiatives to 10 million farmers by end of 2019 and 25 million farmers by end of 2020. This system would not only help farmers develop best practices across crop selection, crop yield management but also allow them to get the best price for their produce. In addition to improving productivity, this would help Government monitor early warning signs of diseases and areas which need most help by utilizing aggregate information from the Agribot. We plan to expand the chatbot to process image inputs by farmers to help provide personalized recommendations on crop growth, diseases and review produce quality using image processing techniques by end of 2020.

These emerging technologies are disrupting investment management, insurance and lending industries creating better user experiences reducing friction. FinTech companies use machine learning and user information to personalize traditional financial services. When users signup for FinTech applications, the application developers request users to provide access personal information like social security information, banking transactions, savings, social media handles and other mobile data. There are many cases where the applications monitor extremely private information like location and voice call information which are not needed to personalize the applications.

The privacy policy conformance to user privacy regulations like COPPA, GDPR is difficult to comprehend. Our project intends to develop an app which can be installed on smartphone and will monitor the data access and usage by various FinTech applications. We use a staggered approach to develop our project and the first step is a detailed study of privacy policies of top 500 FinTech applications on App Store &amp; Google Play. 2.2 Privacy awareness levels and regulation compliance is all over the place To develop the study, we conducted user interviews with users and FinTech startups to understand the key objectives of each stakeholder. The following section provides an overview of user segments and solutions: Key user segments and needs: 2.2.0.1 a) Users: {-}: Users download the apps and use them regularly. They have heterogeneous privacy awareness levels but unanimously like the idea of being aware of data being used by other FinTech apps. #### b) FinTech Startups:{-} Product managers and compliance teams want to be aware of the new privacy regulations and want to benchmark their app privacy with other apps on the App store. #### c) Regulators:{-} Regulators don’t have an automated process to identify missing privacy policies and inconsistencies of policies across the top 500 applications. They also would like to track when privacy policies change for specific applications and would like to review if they conform to various regulations. To further refine our scope, we will limit our study to work with regulators to review our study findings and develop data privacy scoring models. We plan to use the following research methodology: a) Scope of FinTech Apps: We are using data from Crunchbase, Google Play and Apple App Store to extract most funded and most downloaded FinTech Apps. #### b) Privacy policy scraping:{-} Based on the list of FinTech Apps, we retrieve the privacy policies from application websites, Google play pages and Apple app store pages. #### c) Privacy policy text mining:{-} We will run advanced text mining algorithms to compare to human annotated privacy policy data. rank the privacy policy and data privacy information of all the applications. #### d) Results Validation:{-} We will provide the results of text mining to regulators to validate our results and provide feedback on our text mining algorithms. #### e) Feedback &amp; Changes:{-} Once we get detailed feedback from the regulators, we plan to conduct additional user interviews with FinTech startups who are not in compliance. 2.3 Privacy is not a “Feature”: After completing the study, we plan to move forward to build our application. We will offer initial solution to regulators to monitor all the FinTech apps registered in United States. This would allow regulators to coach FinTech startups on improving their compliance to privacy regulations as well as develop new regulations to support the innovations. We also want to develop privacy scoring models to assist FinTech startups to develop better privacy aware products. This will actively allow startups to focus on products which are user privacy compliant reducing possible legal and reputational risks. Next we plan to provide this to users to download on their smart phone and monitor data privacy concerns for their FinTech applications and over time allow them to track all mobile applications. We also intend to extend the analysis to Amazon and windows applications in the future. 2.4 References: J. Lin, B. Liu, N. Sadeh, and J.I.
