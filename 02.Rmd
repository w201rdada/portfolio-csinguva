Mobile Privacy, Text Mining, Natural Language

## A beginning.

When users install smartphone applications, the application developers request users to provide access personal information like photos, call history, SMS & video. Some of this information could be relevant for the best performance of the applications, however there are many cases where the app developers request for extremely private information like location and voice calls which are not needed for the applications. Most of these policies are embedded in the fine text of terms and conditions or the mobile platform permission structure. Even well informed users cannot easily understand the implications of the terms and conditions as well as conformance of app developers with the user privacy regulations like COPPA. With large scale data theft examples like Experian & Yahoo as well as regulations from governemnt entities like FTC & CFPB, ensuring user data privacy is extremely important. Due to various operating systems and devices, managing data privacy across devices becomes a challenging task for users. If the users have children who are accessing the same devices, the problem becomes more critical due the existing privacy regulations. The goal of the idea is to build an text mining based tool to identify the applications used by a user across devices and provide him the apps which are either non complying with the regulations or asking for more data than needed to offer the service. 

## A middle.

The solution is divided into three components:

a) Mobile App Info Extractor: Based on the user's device and applications, the extractor will extract information of all the applications running on the device. Once the applications are identified, for each application, we will retrive the information available on Google Play or Appstore and the app's privacy policy available on the websites.

b) Text Mining: Once the data of applications is retrieved, we will run advanced text mining algorithms to rank the privacy policy and data privacy information of all the applications. 

(c) Results & Monitoring: The outcome of this process would be a report of (i) App Privacy score for each mobile application (ii) List of App's retrieving more data than needed (iii) List of App's which are non compliant with the existing privacy laws  
(d) Industry Specific Results: Develop benchmarks for specific industries like Personal Finance which stores information like SSN.

## An end.

This study intents to extend the existing literature on automated privacy analysis and provides users greater control to manage their privacy choices while downloading mobile apps. We also intend to extend the analysis to Amazon and windows applications in the future.
