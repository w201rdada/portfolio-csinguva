Artificial intelligence is changing the way we work, eat and sleep. I am a huge fan of Peter Norvig's book Artificial Intelligence and I joined MIDS program to learn hard skills to build intelligent systems of the future. To build intelligent systems, we need to start with defining the research problems and intended audience. I kickoff my learning journey outlining two ideas I plan to work in next 12 months:

### Farmer Chatbots {-}

Farmers are dependent on key information to make decisions to improve their crop yield.  The information is related to weather conditions, rainfall, and plant protection. Farmers in developing countries have difficulty finding this information and many countries provide agricultural assistance programs to help farmers to improve best practices data access. Indian government currently provides the farmer assistance services using helpline and automated sms based weather alerts to registered farmers. Only five percent  of 15 million farmers are taking advantage of the helpline service.  The government also intends to expand coverage to 100 million farmers and is requesting proposals to explore alternative ideas to scale the service.  Our team is proposing to build a Farmer Chatbot, which utilizes machine learning to scale this helpline service and making the information they need available whenever they want it. Our vision is disruptive, however we are using a staggered development path to deliver a fully automated Chatbot. Our proposal outlines the first step of building a machine learning supervised helpline service. 


### Mining the fine print - Privacy Scoring  {-}

FinTech companies leverage new technology to create new and better financial services for both consumers and businesses. These emerging technologies are disrupting investment management, insurance and lending industries creating better user experiences reducing friction. FinTech companies use machine learning and user information to personalize traditional financial services. When users signup for FinTech applications, the application developers request users to provide access personal information like social security information, banking transactions, savings, social media handles and other mobile data. There are many cases where the applications monitor extremely private information like location and voice call information which are not needed to personalize the applications. Even though users agree to terms and conditions of using the applciations, the privacy policies are embedded in the fine text of terms and conditions. The privacy policy conformance to user privacy regulations like COPPA, GDPR is difficult to comprehend. Our project intends to develop an app which can be installed on smartphone and will monitor the data access and usage by various FinTech applications. We use a staggered approach to develop our project and the first step is a detailed study of privacy policies of top 500 FinTech applications on App Store & Google Play.
