	abstract = {This paper is part of a research project which highlights the legal and ethical problems of mobile services aimed at children in Spain. The aim of the paper is to offer practical advice on self-regulation in the mobile telephone sector in Spain and to suggest measures that companies could adopt to protect children more effectively. A multivariate statistical analysis was carried out on the results of confidential surveys sent to companies, government agencies and child protection associations in order to establish the key issues to be taken into consideration when drawing up a collective agreement. Children have access to a wide range of services via their mobile phones. We question the suitability of these services and whether the age of the children should be verified before access to these services is allowed. Company policy should include the drawing up of codes of conduct along the lines of the agreement signed by the leading European mobile phone operators.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a first attempt to provide an economic value to mobile users' private information. We claim that when users grant access to an application's required permissions, they disclose private information and data to third parties and let them possibly make revenues out of it. To put a monetary value to such information, we use the price of non-free applications. We use a linear model trained on the 5,187 non-free Arcade apps in Google Play Store that takes a set of permissions in input and estimates the corresponding price. Under the assumption that users "pay" free applications by providing access to more private information (i.e. permissions) and consequently the more permissions are required the less users pay the application, our research aim at showing that the estimated price provides a good proxy to attribute a quantitative value to private and sensitive information of mobile apps' users.},

The act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age. It details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those under 13.
While children under 13 can legally give out personal information with their parents' permission, many websites – particularly social media sites — disallow underage children from using their services altogether due to the cost and work involved in complying with the law.},

	abstract = {In a variety of industries ranging from agriculture to electronics and oil, procurement takes place through a combination of bilateral fixed-price contracts and open market trading among supply chain participants, which allows them to improve supply chain performance by utilizing new demand and cost information. The strategic behavior of the participants in these markets interacts with the way fixed-price contracts are formulated and significantly affects supply chain efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate fixed-price contracting even though the fixed price is determined under inferior information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus. However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain, spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement shifts from fixed-price contracting to spot trading and in the limit, the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the manufacturers.},
